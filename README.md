# Nydus Map Pool

This is a repository for submitting maps to the `mindustry.nydus.app` server.<br>
To submit maps use the Pull Request feature of github.

### Rules:

1: Map has to be a `.msav` file.<br>
2: Filename must be fairly similar to the in-game name of the map.<br>
3: Map must not be a copy of an existing map in the repository.<br>

Feel free to add (or remove) maps via pull requests based solely on your own opinion,<br>
don't be afraid to offend people with your own taste :slightly_smiling_face:<br>
(discussing them can happen in the pull request)
